				The K-12 program, or the Kindergarten and the 12 years of elementary and secondary education, has been brought to attention since its first year of implementation. Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (cited in Reyes, 2015). However, although some people still cannot see its relevance, reforms in the educational system is very much needed in the country. Uyquiengco (2014) said that prior to its implementation, the Philippines was one of the only three countries in the world that still had 10 years of basic education. Moreover, the National Achievement Test results show poor performance of students in the country. Although some people would not agree with its implementation, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.

				<p id="text">The K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education. In contrast with the old curriculum, the K-12 program offers a more focused and improved educational system in the country. With the compulsory and mandatory kindergarten education, children at the age of 5 will have time to slowly adjust to their formal education. Moreover, according to the Department of Education (2012), a better understanding of the basic concepts taught will be ensured through the use of mother tongue as the medium of instruction. In addition, with the additional 2 years in high school, students will be given more time to master competencies and skills through the specialized upper secondary education.
				</p>
				<p id="text">However, in ensuring that learners will receive a better quality of education, an improved school facilities and materials will be needed. Some believe that the K-12 implementers did not take into consideration the issue on the inadequacy of facilities and other materials. Schools are also not yet ready to accommodate more students in the very limited facilities due to the additional 2 years in high school. In addition, as Isagani Cruz (2010) wrote in his article, “Currents subjects should be fixed first instead of adding new ones. The problem is the content, not the length, of basic education.”
