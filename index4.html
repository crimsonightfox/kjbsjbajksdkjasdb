  </div></center>
		<center><div id="sub">Senior High School (SHS) refers to the last two years of the K to 12 Program, namely Grades 11 and 12. </div></center>
		<p id="suby"><span id="theme">K to 12 is Your Key...<br> <br></span>
<span id="theme">To the World <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">Just like learners your age all over the world, you too will <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">benefit from an education system suited for the 21st <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">century<br>. </span>
<span id="theme">To Your Dreams <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">The things you will study in SHS are based on your <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">interests. SHS will be your stepping stone to be what you <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">want to be after high school. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">To a Better Life <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">SHS equips you with the knowledge and skills to pursue a <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">better life and help your family and community <br><br><br></span>
 
<span id="theme">What’s in it for me? <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">K to 12 and SHS were designed with your best interest in mind. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">They are products of years of research, planning, and consultation <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">that take into account the child, community, content, competencies, <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">culture, career, and choice. You, the learners, are at the heart <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">of the SHS curriculum. It recognizes your characteristics, addresses <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">your needs, and values your personal choices. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">An enhanced curriculum was created to give you the best possible <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">tools and career choices after high school. You may not have <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">realized it but your existing lessons in recent years have been <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">modified to get you ready for SHS. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">Your teachers have been trained and prepared for K to 12. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">You will be part of the K to 12 generation and your teachers, <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">schools, and education system are ready for this. <br><br></span>
 <br><br>
<span id="theme">Can I go straight to college when I finish <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">Grade 10? <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">No, because the law now prescribes SHS as part of compulsory <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">basic education. Once fully implemented in School Year (SY) <br><br></span></span>
<span id="theme">2016-17, you will need to go through it in order to graduate High <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">School. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">What are the benefits of SHS? <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">Graduating from SHS may lead to Employment, Entrepreneurship, <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">Higher Education, and Middle-Level Skills Development. <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">You’ll need to finish SHS to complete your basic education. Otherwise, <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">you’ll be a Grade 10 or Junior High School completer and <br><br></span>
<span id="theme">receive a Junior High School completion certificate. <br><br></span>
 
<span id="theme">What if I don’t want to go to SHS? <br><br></span></span>
